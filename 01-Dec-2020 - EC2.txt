----------
1) Status checks
2) Protecting instance with accidental termination?
3) Scale  up  / scale out
4) Creating our own AMI
5) Snapshot

Select Mumbai region
Launch instance ---> Amazon linux ---> Review and launch  ( Takes the dafult options)
Launch --> Create new keypair ---> View instance

Lets name the instance as - test

Observe the status check - Initializing  ,  2/2 checks passed

In availability zone , we have physical hard disk.
On top of physical hard drive ---> we have virtualization software ( Xen hypervisor )

On Virtualization software , we have Ec2  machine

What is the meaning of 2/2 check passed?
check 1 - Instance status check
check 2 - System status check

Lets say  we have status check as  1/2 ?
what does that mean?
It means instance status check is failed.

Lets say  we have status check as  0/2 ?
what does that mean?
It means system status check is failed.
When system status ( hard ware ) is failed , obviously  instance will fail.

Troubleshoot
-----------------
For status check as  1/2 ?
Solution: Reboot the instance
When we reboot, OS will be reloaded.


For status check as  0/2 ?
Solution: Stop and start the instance
Ec2 machine will be migrated to another physical machine

+++++++++++++++++++++++



Select the instance---> Status check tab
We can see  System status check and instance status check

+++++++++++++++++++++++
How can we protect the instance with accidental termination?
Go to actions ----> instance settings ---> change termination protection --> yes, Enable

Now, we cannot terminate the machine.

Incase you want to terminate, just disable change termination protection

Understanding terminology
1)  scale up and scale down
2)  scale out  and scale in




1) scale up  and scale down -- 

scale up  : This is also called as vertical scaling
	Lets say i have one machine of 10gb hard disk.
                  Adding additional 10gb  hard disk in the same machine is called  scaleup.



Scale out :  This is called horizontal  scaling 
	  Lets say i have one machine of 10gb hard disk.
                    Adding additional machine with 10gb hard disk  
	

Note: Auto scaling comes under  scale out

Does AWS support scaleup?
Yes,  Once the instance is created, we can increate and decrease the hardware (  CPU, RAM, HDD )

How can we do that?
Observe the machine we have launched, instance type is t2.micro 
t2.micro comes with 1 CPU core and 1 GB ram.
Can we increase?
First we need to stop the machine.
then go to
Actions---> Instance settings ---> Change instance type
Now, we have multiple options, Lets select  t2.medium --- Apply

Note: t2.medium  comes with 2 CPU cores and 4 GB ram

Now, Lets change the instance type to t2.micro ---  Apply

Can we increase the hard disk
-----------------------------------
TO increase the hard disk, we do not need to stop the machine.
Machine can be in running state.
Lets start the machine
Go to volumes option in dashboard, Select the Volume 
Actions ----> Modify  Volume ---- Size - 10  ( change to required size ) --> Modify--> Yes --> CLose
It will take time to reflect.

Attach / Detach Volume




Launch instance --> Amazon Linux ---> Next -- Next -- Step 4: Add two new volume
Observer  Delete on termination  ( only 1st volume is selected ).
This means, when we terminare the machine, only C: Drive is termintated )

Now select 2nd and 3rd check box  ( now all volumes will be terminated )

Next ---> Add name tag -- sunil --> Next --- Next -- Launch -- Select existing key pair ---> Launch -- View Instance

Now, I want to detach one volume ( not c drive )  ( from Sunil machine  and  add to  another machine ( demo )

Go to volume  
Select the 1st volume --> Actions -- Detach volume-- Yes, detach
Status will be changed to available

Select the same volume --> Action -- Attach Volume -- Select demo instance --> Attach.

Now, If you want to attach or detach C: Drive ( root )   
We need to stop the machines
